### [Joel Crossley](#joel-crossley)
- **Project**: Redesign of KPC Book Protections Website
- **Testimonial**:  
  > "Took a leading role in redesigning pretty much every page on the KPC Book Protections website. KPC's website has multiple transactions throughout the day, and therefore it was essential the website was live throughout the process. Any downtime would result in loss of sales. MJWeb completed all the updates with no issues. I would 100% recommend using them for anything small or large."

### [Kevin Campos](#kevin-campos)

### [Dan Lockwood](#dan-lockwood)
- **Project**: Copywriting and Marketing Services
- **Testimonial**:  
  > "As someone who has previously done all of their company advertising personally, I never felt the need to engage with and pay for an external provider. It was only when I required assistance with my copyright services that I found MJWeb, and I couldn‚Äôt recommend them enough. Outside of their core offering, which includes a series of 5 email sequences a month along with a series of Facebook advertisements, they were at hand to support with ad hoc queries in and around the topic to ensure I was both informed and comfortable with the specialist marketing being conducted. Not only has this led to me increasing the number of clients gained from my outreach, though has allowed me to prioritise my time into other value-adding aspects to my company. I look forward to continuing working together - 5 stars!"
